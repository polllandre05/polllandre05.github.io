<h4> Nickname: <strong>Pol</strong></h4>

<h4> Favorite CMSC subject so far: <strong>"CMSC 123"</strong>, because i find it challenging yet it made me understand a lot about the applications of each course topic. </h4>

<h4> Favorite GE so far: <strong>"STS"</strong>, because my STS instructor made it easy for us to understand every topic while providing us a good time with lots of activities and exercises. </h4>

<h4> Favorite Programming Language: <strong>"C"</strong>, becuase i felt comfortable coding in C, also i think C is a good programming language for general coding. </h4>
